 *  If you use fetch It produces an error
 *  But when I load the page I Obtain this error:
 *    Access to fetch at  from origin  has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
 *    If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.
 *
 * This 0error occurs because of the CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy which is implemented by the server hosting
 * the resource you are trying to access. This policy restricts cross-origin requests made by web browsers, for security reasons.
